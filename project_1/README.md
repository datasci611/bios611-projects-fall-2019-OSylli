**Bios 611 Project 1** (Yilun Li)

## Background Information and Data Source

Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) is an organization that connects with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty. Here, we've got a dataset from the organization which has recorded the assistance to those in need, including food support, clothing items assistance, financial support and so on. We will perform some analysis on the dataset so that we could have a better view of the data and provide more useful suggestions for future operations.

## Purpose of Project

In this project, we mainly focus on columns (variables) "Date", "Food Pounds" and "Clothing Items". We are going to explore their relationships by discussing how the number of clothing items recorded change over time. Also we'll try to figure out the relationship between the amount of food support and clothing item, and see whether a relatively large amount of food support and a large amount of clothing assistance would tend to occur at the same time.

## Methods of Data Analysis

Generally speaking, in the project, techniques for data wrangling and data visualization with *R Studio* will be primarily used. Functions from package "tidyverse" and "ggplot2" would be frequently applied. And results will be presented with the assistance of figures and tables in addition to necessary code.

## Others

Any feedback or suggestions on the project is always welcomed!
